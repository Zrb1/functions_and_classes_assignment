"""
Write a function that takes 2 strings s1 and s2 as inputs. These strings will represent times of the day and will be written in the format
HH:MM:SS. Your function should return the number of seconds between these 2 times. You may assume s2 always represents a later time than s1.
There are a number of ways to do this problem, but you will find making use of the datetime.datetime and datetime.timedelta modules will make
things easiest. For example, f('08:59:59','10:24:31') should return 5072.
